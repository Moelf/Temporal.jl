However, the motivation for developing Temporal and its flagship TS type was driven by a small number of design decisions and semantics used in TimeSeries that could arguably/subjectively prove inconvenient. A few that stood out as sufficient motivation for a new package are given below.","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/#","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"A key difference is that Temporal's TS type is defined to be mutable, whereas the TimeSeries TimeArray type is defined to be immutable\nSince in Julia, an object of immutable type \"is passed around (both in assignment statements and in function calls) by copying, whereas a mutable type is passed around by reference\" (see here), the TS type can be a more memory-efficient option\nThis assumes that proper care is taken to modify the object only when desired, a consideration inseparable from pass-by-reference semantics\nAdditionally, making the TS object mutable should provide greater ease & adaptability when modifying the object's fields\nIts indexing functionality operates differently than expected for the Array type, such that the TimeArray cannot be indexed in the same manner\nFor example, indexing columns must be done with Strings, requiring Array-like indexing syntax to be done on the underlying values member of the object\nAdditionally, this difference in indexing syntax could cause confusion for newcomers and create unnecessary headaches in basic data munging and indexing tasks\nThe syntax is similar to that of the DataFrame class in Python. While this a familiar framework, R's xts class is functionally equivalent to the matrix clas\nIn like fashion, a goal of this package is for the TS type to behave like an Array as much as possible, but offer more flexibility when joining/merging through the use of *temporal- indexing, to simplify challenges uniquely associated with managing time series data structures\nAnother difference between TS and TimeSeries lies in the existence of a \"metadata\" holder for the object\nWhile this feature may be useful in some cases, the TS object will likely occupy less memory than an equivalent TimeSeries object, simply because it does not hold any metadata about the object\nIn cases where such underlying metadata is of use, there are likely ways to access it without attaching it to the object\nA deliberate stylistic decision was made in giving Temporal's time series type a compact name\nWhile the TimeSeries package names its type TimeArray, typing out nine characters can slow one down when prototyping in the REPL\nCreating a type alias is certainly a perfectly acceptable workaround, but only having to type TS (or ts) when constructing the type can save a considerable amount of time if you're experimenting in the REPL for any length of time\nAdditionally, if you don't want to type out field names every time you instantiate a new time series, the TS class will auto-populate field names for you","category":"page"},{"location":"overview/#","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"So in all, the differences between the two classes are relatively stylistic, but over time will hopefully increase efficiency both when writing and running code.","category":"page"},{"location":"aggregation/#Aggregation-1","page":"Aggregation","title":"Aggregation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"aggregation/#Sampling-1","page":"Aggregation","title":"Sampling","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"aggregation/#Weekdays-1","page":"Aggregation","title":"Weekdays","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"aggregation/#","page":"Aggregation","title":"Aggregation","text":"mondays\ntuesdays\nwednesdays\nthursdays\nfridays\nsaturdays\nsundays","category":"page"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.mondays","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.mondays","text":"mondays(x::TS)\n\nReturn a time series containing all observations occuring on Mondays of the given TS object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.tuesdays","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.tuesdays","text":"tuesdays(x::TS)\n\nReturn a time series containing all observations occuring on Tuesdays of the given TS object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.wednesdays","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.wednesdays","text":"wednesdays(x::TS)\n\nReturn a time series containing all observations occuring on Wednesdays of the given TS object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.thursdays","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.thursdays","text":"thursdays(x::TS)\n\nReturn a time series containing all observations occuring on Thursdays of the given TS object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.fridays","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.fridays","text":"fridays(x::TS)\n\nReturn a time series containing all observations occuring on Fridays of the given TS object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.saturdays","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.saturdays","text":"saturdays(x::TS)\n\nReturn a time series containing all observations occuring on Saturdays of the given TS object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.sundays","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.sundays","text":"sundays(x::TS)\n\nReturn a time series containing all observations occuring on Sundays of the given TS object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"aggregation/#Interval-Boundaries-1","page":"Aggregation","title":"Interval Boundaries","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"aggregation/#Weekly-1","page":"Aggregation","title":"Weekly","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"aggregation/#","page":"Aggregation","title":"Aggregation","text":"bow\neow","category":"page"},{"location":"aggregation/#Temporal.bow","page":"Aggregation","title":"Temporal.bow","text":"bow(x::TS;
